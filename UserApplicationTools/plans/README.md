# Plans Index

Development and deployment planning for [User Application Tools](../README.md).

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [development-phases.md](./development-phases.md) | Phased build order: Verify first → Build → Embed (API, mobile, extension) → Desktop & capture → AI & PaaS. |
| [tech-stack.md](./tech-stack.md) | Suggested stacks per app (web, API, desktop, mobile, extension, AI) and shared protocol layer. |
| [deployment.md](./deployment.md) | Hosting, domains, secrets, caching, and operations for API, web apps, mobile, desktop, and AI. |

Use these as living docs: adjust phases and stacks to match team size and priorities.
