# ChainForge AI – Must-Do List (ETHDenver 2026 Buidlathon)

**All times MST.**  
**Event:** Feb 18–21 · National Western Center · ETHERSPACE track + sponsor bounties.

## About tables / booths

You **do not** reserve or pay for a demo table separately. Submitting your project on **Devfolio** (ETHERSPACE + bounties) is your Buidlathon registration. Accepted projects usually get an **assigned table** at the Community Judging Fair (check the event site or app for “Locate table” / your row & table number). If you’re unsure, confirm with ETHDenver (website or Discord). Either way, have your **demo kit** ready: laptop with live app, QR cards, and demo script—for your table, a judging walk-through, or an ad‑hoc pitch.

## Camp BUIDL schedule (do not conflict)

**Feb 15–17:** Camp BUIDL at **CSU Spur Hydro Building**, **9:00 AM – 5:00 PM** each day.  
All must-do tasks below are scheduled **before 9 AM** or **after 5 PM** on those days so you can attend every session.
