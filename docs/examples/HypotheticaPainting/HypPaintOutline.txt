This outline details six stages for a rare Picasso painting (valued at ~$8-12 million). For each stage, I've listed **key provenance event information** (core facts like location, GPS with six decimal places, transactions) and **supporting files** (hypothetical artifacts like images, reports). No actual content generation here—just the refined structure.
